# AP Election Data Parser

A simple Python tool for scraping 2018-2024 election data from the Associated Press (AP) election results website. Data is sourced from the [AP News 2024 Election Results](https://apnews.com/projects/election-results-2024/).

As of this time I have not found a URL for 2016 and before data.
