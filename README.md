# AP Election Data Parser

A simple Python tool for scraping 2018-2024 election data from the Associated Press (AP) election results website. Data is sourced from the [AP News Election Results](https://apnews.com/projects/election-results-2024/).

I am not sure as to whether AP has data from 2012 and before, at the very least I have not found a way to access it.
